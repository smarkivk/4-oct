import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main { 
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");
    System.out.println(cars);
  } 
}
Here's what the program does step by step:

It imports the ArrayList class from the java.util package.
It defines a class named "Main."
Inside the main method:
It creates an ArrayList named "cars" that can hold strings (String).
It uses the add method to add four car brand names to the "cars" ArrayList.
It prints the contents of the "cars" ArrayList using System.out.println(cars).
When you run this program, it will display the following output:

csharp
Copy code
[Volvo, BMW, Ford, Mazda]
This output shows that the car brand names have been successfully added to the ArrayList, and the ArrayList's contents are printed inside square brackets.
